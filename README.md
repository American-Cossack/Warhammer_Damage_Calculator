#### 
This will be a project to create an app that will calculate the average damage dealt by an attack in the game of Warhammer 40k, based on certain parameters. This project will be built using Mongoose, Express, React, and Node. As a stretch goal, the calculations will be slightly changed, so that it works off of the stats of Warhammer Fantasy instead.  The project should output, after taking a series of inputs for both attacker and defender, average wounds dealt, average dead models, total hits, and total wounds. Another stretch goal will be to have multiple possible types of attacks into one output. The prototype for this app is [here](https://www.mathhammer8thed.com/web/).
